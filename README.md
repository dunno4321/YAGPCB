#### Yet another general purpose Twitch chatbot made by dunno4321. For questions, DM @dunno4321 on Discord


## Installation
You can either follow these steps to build & run it OR go to the Releases tab and download the .exe file and follow the instructions there
1. Download and install this by clicking (on GitHub) code --> download ZIP, and extract it to a known location
2. [Install Python](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/install-python-windows-10)
3. [Install PIP](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-pip-on-windows/#). It should install with Python, but it's better to check
4. Open File Explorer and navigate to this folder
5. In the address bar, type "cmd"
6. Type "`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`" into Command Prompt. This will install the required libraries
    - If it returns something like "python is not recognized as a...", try running just `python` and install it from the Microsoft Store or try restarting your PC
7. When that has finished installing, follow [these steps](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication/register-app/) to create & register a bot and take note of your `client_id` and your `client_secret`
8. Set "OAuth Redirect URL" to "https://localhost:3000/token"
9. To connect with twitch, run the bot with `python main.py` and navigate to [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) in your web browser
10. Enter the client id, secret, and your channel name and click Save. All of this data is stored locally in assets/config.json
11. The bot should connect and print some information (the bot's username, user id, and connected channels)

## Running the bot
1. Open this folder in File Explorer
2. Type "cmd" into the address bar
3. Type `python main.py` into the command prompt
4. It will ask you to click the link to authorize the bot with Twitch
5. Click the link and follow the instructions to authorize the bot
6. The bot should connect and print some debug info about the username and user ID of the bot.
7. You should now be able to type !ping into your chat and have the bot respond with Pong!
8. If something doesn't work, go to assets/log.log and do a ctrl+F for "error" or DM me on Discord @dunno4321 with the log file
9. The web dashboard is located at [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000)

- comment the code, dangit
- Websockets to handle subscriptions & whatnot (needs outward-facing IP - repl.it? port forwarding?)
